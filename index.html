                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="body-text">
                    This project was a study in understanding and modeling user interactions with an interface.
                    Information
                    was gathered through <b>observations and interviews</b>, and was then used to create <b>user
                        personas</b> and a
                    <b>storyboard</b> modeling an example interaction.
                </p>


                <h3>The interface of choice: CVS self-checkout</h3>

                <div class="img-wrapper">

                </div>

                <p>This interface is one of two identical self-checkout kiosks at the CVS on Angell St. in Providence.
                    It provides an alternative to the traditional checkout with a cashier. There is a scanner
                    where customers
                    can scan their own items <b>[1]</b>, a small flat ledge next to it for bagging items <b>[2]</b>, a
                    touchscreen where they can make selections related to their purchase and payment method <b>[3]</b>,
                    and a
                    payment module with a a card reader and PIN pad <b>[4]</b>.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="page-section secondary">
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <h2>Gathering Information</h2>

                <p>The process began with preparing some questions about user experiences with the interface that would
                    define the focus for my data collection. I chose
                    questions that targeted understanding <b>motivation, learnability, and memorability</b> as well as
                    <b>common frustrations</b> with the system.
                </p>

                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Why did you opt to use the self-checkout?</li>
                    <li>
                        Have you used it before? <br />
                        If yes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>How do you feel your ability to interact with the interface has changed over multiple
                                uses? Have you found it easier, harder, or the same?</li>
                            <li>How often do you go to CVS, and of those instances can you give a rough percentage of
                                how often you use self-checkout?</li>
                        </ul>
                        If no:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                What aspect of the interface was most helpful in indicating to you how it should be
                                used?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What aspect of the interface confused you the most or most impeded your ability to use
                                the interface?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Did you read all of the text instructions/buttons provided before making choices?</li>
                    <li>
                        Would you say that any of the following factors of your purchase influenced your decision and/or
                        experience using the self-checkout?
                        <ul>
                            <li>payment method</li>
                            <li>number of items</li>
                            <li>type of items</li>
                            <li>time spent in the store</li>
                            <li>other</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you could change one thing about the interface what would it be?</li>
                </ol>

                <br />
                <p>I then went out into the field to get answers to these questions. I observed users using the kiosk at
                    CVS and then interviewed those who were willing using the questions above. I was able to collect
                    information from <b>three users</b>. Below is a summary of my findings.</p>

                <h3>Overall Observations</h3>

                <p>All of the observed users approached the system without much hesitation. They scanned their items and
                    tapped through the instructions quickly, without waiting for the machine to finish its verbal
                    prompts, indicating a level of familiarity or understanding without needing explicit instructions.
                    There was also very little delay in navigating the different parts of the interface such as moving
                    from the scanner to the touchscreen to the bagging area to the card reader.</p>

                <h3>User Surveys</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All of the interviewed users had used the system before and felt familiar with the interface,
                        finding it consistently easy to use overall</li>
                    <li>They estimated using the self-checkout 50-100% of the time when shopping at CVS, which ranged
                        from
                        every other day to once a week on average (with the exception of items that require cashier
                        approval
                        and/or occasionally cause the kiosk to error and request assistance)</li>
                    <li>Most users said that they only read the text instructions during their first experience with the
                        interface, able to go through the physical motions afterwards without needing or wanting the
                        prompts, and one even mentioned remembering how to scan their favorite items quicker because
                        they
                        could easily find and position the barcodes for the scanner</li>
                    <li>All users said they used the self-checkout because they found it quicker, though with slightly
                        different additions to that reasoning: one didn't want to wait for the cashier to be available,
                        one
                        said they didn't want to have to talk to anyone, and one said that they only needed to buy a
                        couple
                        of small items</li>
                    <li>Multiple users reported disatisfaction with the bagging area, as they found it frustrating that
                        the system would not allow them to finish checking out until the items were properly placed for
                        bagging and that the sensor some times would not detect lighter weight items
                </ul>

                <br />

                <p>It's worth noting that the collected data was very uniform. I was unable to find anyone who had not
                    used the self-checkout before or at least had little experience. The age range was also condensed to
                    users in their 20s to early 30s, as the few people I approached outside of that demographic
                    expressed that they did not want to take a survey.</p>

        <div class="page-section primary">
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <h2>Personas</h2>

                <p>Based on the collected responses above, I formulated two personas that could model potential users of
                    the CVS self-checkout. Each of these personas is represented by a four quadrant empathy map that
                    expresses what the user might <b>think, feel, say, and do</b>.</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>almost always uses the self-checkout so she can quickly pop in and out during a break
                                in her busy schedule of classes and meetings</li>
                            <li>very comfortable with the interface, able to scan things that she usually buys without
                                too much effort</li>
                            <li>well acquainted with quirks of the system like the tricky bagging area</li>

                            <li>often uses the self checkout, but not always</li>
                            <li>depends on how crowded it is and if he's buying larger items</li>
                            <li>doesn't need step by step instructions, but is still not as aware of less common

                <h2>Storyboard</h2>

                <p>The last step of this project was to take one of the personas (Michael) and model an interaction they
                    might have with the interface. I created a storyboard in which I tried to capture some of the
                    motivation, emotions, and struggles the user could experience while using the self-checkout.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project pushed me not only to think deeply about formulating questions that guide the assessment
                    of an existing interface, but also provided me with tools for understanding users that would help in
                    designing my own interfaces. Overall, it was an interesting experience in breaking down user
                    interactions with an interface.</p>
